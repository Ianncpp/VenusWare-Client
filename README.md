# → A little story of this
It was a blurry and stormy day, that promised to be boring. I was sitting at my laptop and doing some work for the college. In a moment I got bored and decided to hop on a Minecraft server. 
There I found a guy that was looking for someone that could make a simple site for him and his friend, for payment. This guys' names are Arteom and Mathew. At the moment i thgought will be a nice idea to try myself on a such project, especially because I hadn't anything to ocuppy my brain. I asked what kinda site he wants, he said "let's go in a voice so we could disscus about it". He told me everything, we joked a little and i started coding it. 
So like that I created some cool memories and got a chance do gather some experience.

# → From idea to code
**What started as a random chat turned into a coding session.  
I opened my editor, set up the project structure, and began shaping the site line by line.  
It wasn’t just about HTML, CSS, and JS — it was about turning a simple request into something real.  
Every commit felt like progress, every bug was a lesson, and in the end I realized:  
coding isn’t only about delivering a product, it’s also about the story behind it.**

# → Is this usable?
### **No.** At least for you who might find my repository. Maybe could serve you as a source of inspiration, nothing more.
